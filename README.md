<h1>JPet Sound Demon</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This C++ source code includes two main parts. The first part, the implementation code, demonstrates the use of classes and inheritance by creating instances of different pets (dogs, cats, and birds) with specific attributes, and it calls various methods to display their information, sounds they make, and owner tags. The second part contains the source code for a class hierarchy, including a base class "Pet" with derived classes like "Dog," "Cat," "Bird," and "Turtle." Each derived class overrides the "speak" method to produce appropriate animal sounds. The "Pet" class also provides methods for obtaining pet information and owner tags. .
